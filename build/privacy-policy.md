# Migo Privacy Policy
Effective Date: November 04, 2024

Vectorscale Technologies LLC ("Vectorscale," "we," "us" or "our") provides a friend-finding and dating service and mobile app, powered by AI chatbot technology, to understand what matters most to you and identify potentially compatible users of our service (the "Migo Service"). This Privacy Policy describes how Vectorscale processes personal information that we collect through the Migo Service, any other digital properties or services that link to this Privacy Policy (including our website), and our related services (collectively, the "Service"). 

## Personal Information We Collect

### Information You Provide to Us
Personal information you may provide to us through the Service or otherwise includes account data, such as the username and password that you may set to establish an online account on the Service, your first and last name, email address, profile photo, and phone number. When you complete your profile, you may provide profile data, such as your date of birth, gender, photographs, educational background, professional information, and responses to our chatbot questions about your personal interests, preferences, and what you're looking for in potential connections. Your profile data may include sensitive information you choose to provide such as relationship preferences and interests.

We collect communications data based on our exchanges with you, including when you interact with our chatbot, communicate with other users, contact us through customer support, or otherwise engage with our Service. This includes the content of your messages, responses to chatbot questions, and any feedback or concerns you share with us.

Payment data and transaction information are collected when you make purchases through our Service. While we do not store complete payment card information, as this is handled directly by our payment processors, we may receive and store limited payment information such as the last four digits of your payment card, the expiration date, and billing address to help us prevent fraud and process refunds.

When you use our Service, you may generate and share user content, such as photos, messages, comments, and other information you make available through the Service. Please note that other users may be able to save or copy content you share, so you should carefully consider what information you make available through the Service.

### Information We Collect Automatically
When you use our Service, we automatically collect certain information about your device and how you interact with our Service. This includes device data, such as your computer or mobile device's operating system type and version, manufacturer and model, browser type, screen resolution, device type, IP address, unique identifiers (including identifiers used for advertising purposes), language settings, mobile carrier, and general location information such as city, state, or geographic area.

We also collect information about your usage of the Service, including pages or screens you view, time spent on pages or screens, navigation paths between pages or screens, information about your activity on a page or screen, access times, and duration of access. Our systems automatically record information about your interactions with our chatbot, including the questions asked, responses given, and patterns of engagement.

### Location Information
With your permission, we may collect precise location information from your device when you use the Service. This information helps us provide location-based features and improve our Service. You can disable location services through your device settings at any time, though this may limit certain features of the Service.

## Tracking, AI & Other Technologies

### AI and Chatbot Technologies
Our Service employs advanced artificial intelligence technologies, including services provided by third-party AI services (for example, OpenAI), to power our chatbot and matching systems. When you interact with our chatbot, these AI providers may process information about your IP address, general geographic location, and the content of your conversations to facilitate the provision of the Service. We use these technologies to understand your preferences, assess compatibility with other users, and provide personalized recommendations for connections and activities.

Our AI systems process the personal information you make available to us in connection with our matching algorithms and machine learning models. This processing helps us assess personality traits, identify potential compatibility between users, and enhance the safety and security of our platform. All AI processing is conducted in accordance with our terms of service and applicable laws.

### Automated Decision Making
Our Service uses automated systems to process certain data and make decisions about potential matches and recommendations. These systems analyze your profile information, chatbot interactions, and usage patterns to suggest compatible connections and activities. While our systems are designed to enhance your experience, you maintain control over your connections and can choose whether to interact with suggested matches.

## How We Use Your Information

We use your personal information to operate, maintain, and improve our Service. This includes creating and managing your account, processing your chatbot interactions, facilitating connections between users, and providing customer support. We analyze user behavior and service performance to enhance our matching algorithms, improve our chatbot's effectiveness, and develop new features that better serve our community.

Our systems use your information to customize your experience, including tailoring match recommendations and suggested activities based on your preferences and behavior. We also use this information to maintain the safety and security of our platform, prevent fraud and abuse, and enforce our terms of service.

## How We Share Your Information

We may share your personal information with the following parties and in the following circumstances:

### Service Providers
Third parties that provide services on our behalf or help us operate the Service or our business. These include payment processors who handle secure payment transactions, email verification services through Twilio/Sendgrid for user verification and communications, AI technology providers such as OpenAI who process chatbot interactions, cloud hosting providers who store our data, analytics providers who help us understand user behavior, and security services that help protect our users. We share only the information necessary for these providers to perform their functions and require them to protect your information in accordance with our standards.

We may share your personal information with professional advisors, including lawyers, auditors, accountants, security consultants, and other professional advisors as needed in the course of the professional services they render to us. These professional advisors are bound by confidentiality obligations and use any personal information we share only for the purposes of providing professional services to us.

### Other Users
When you create a profile on Migo, certain information is visible to other users of the Service. This includes your first name, age, photos you choose to share, and general location. Your responses to chatbot questions may be used to generate a public profile summary, but the specific conversations remain private. When you connect with another user, additional information may become visible to that user based on your privacy settings and mutual interaction.

### Safety and Security
We cooperate with law enforcement inquiries and take seriously our responsibility to report illegal or harmful conduct. We may disclose your information when we believe in good faith that disclosure is necessary to:
- Comply with a legal requirement or process
- Protect the safety of any person
- Prevent or investigate possible wrongdoing
- Protect our rights or property
- Address fraud, security, or technical issues

### Business Transfers
If Vectorscale or the Migo Service is involved in a merger, acquisition, or sale of all or a portion of its assets, your information may be transferred as part of that transaction. We will notify you via email and/or a prominent notice on our Service of any change in ownership or uses of your personal information.

## Security

We employ technical, organizational, and physical safeguards designed to protect your personal information. These measures include:

Encryption of data in transit and at rest using industry-standard protocols. We utilize secure servers protected by firewalls and monitor our systems for potential vulnerabilities. Access to personal information is restricted to authorized employees who require it to perform their job functions.

However, no security system is impenetrable, and we cannot guarantee the security of our systems 100%. In the event that any information under our control is compromised as a result of a breach of security, we will take reasonable steps to investigate the situation and notify those individuals whose information may have been compromised, in accordance with any applicable laws and regulations.

## Your Rights and Choices

### Account Deletion
You may delete your account at any time through the Service's settings. When you request account deletion, we will initiate a 7-day grace period during which you may reactivate your account. After this period, we will permanently delete your account and associated data in accordance with our data retention policies, though certain information may be retained as required by law or for legitimate business purposes.

### California Privacy Rights
For users who are California residents, the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) provides specific rights regarding personal information. These include:

The right to know about the personal information we collect about you and how it is used and shared. We have detailed the categories of personal information we collect in this Privacy Policy, along with how we use and share this information.

## Children's Privacy

The Migo Service is only for users aged 18 and older. We do not knowingly collect or solicit personal information from anyone under the age of 18 or knowingly allow such persons to register for our Service. If we become aware that we have collected personal information from a child under age 18, we will take steps to delete that information promptly. If you believe that we might have any information from or about a child under 18, please contact us immediately.

## Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page and updating the "Effective Date" at the top. If we make material changes to how we treat our users' personal information, we will notify you by email to the primary email address associated with your account and/or through a notice on our Service prior to the change becoming effective.

You are advised to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any changes. Changes to this Privacy Policy are effective when they are posted on this page. Your continued use of the Service after we make changes is deemed to be acceptance of those changes.
